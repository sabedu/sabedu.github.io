I am Samuel, a Software Engineering PhD student under Dr Emad Shihab's supervision at Concordia University. I had my master's and bachelor's degrees from the University of Ghana and the University of Cape Coast respectively. I previously worked as a software engineer, where I was involved in planning, designing, developing and deploying software products. My research interests are in LM4SE, mining software repositories, software engineering for AI systems and explainable AI models for software engineering.
